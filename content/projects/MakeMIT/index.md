Over 3 million people suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome, a condition causing tingling and numbness in the hands and arms that impairs daily activities. Our team includes someone who experiences this and cannot perform high-torque motions with their hand. In just 24 hours, we engineered a grasping system to restore function. The interface sleeve detects hand motions and actuates a robotic claw to grab, bend, and twist objects, offloading work from the tender wrist. This assistive device is a start to granting people with carpal tunnel more mobility and independence.

## MakeMIT 2022: Chord-inate
### IoT-Enabled Self-Playing Guitar

Award: First Place

The COVID-19 pandemic halted live music, so we created a solenoid-actuated IoT system to enable remote guitar playing. In just 24 hours, we developed hardware that straps onto any guitar and links it to a website. This allows individual users to access and play a guitar remotely. It also provides a way for multiple users to play music together virtually.
