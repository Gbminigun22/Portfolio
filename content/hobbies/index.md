Some of my hobbies that I keep up with in my free time at school or on break

## Sailing
<img class="thumbnailshadow" src="images/sailingteam.JPG"/>

Ever since I was introduced to sailing as a child, I've continued my passion through competitive sailing in highschool as well as the [varsity sailing team](https://mitathletics.com/sports/sailing/roster/garrett-blosen/10519) here at MIT.

## Music

I've played piano and cello for over 12 years each, competiting in various solo and chamber competitions in highschool. I've continued playing cello at MIT as part of the [Chamber Music Society](https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/mit-chamber-music-society).

I've accumulated my repertoir of pieces I've learned or performed in a spotify playlist

## Making Things

### 3D Printing

After being exposed to 3D printing in my robotics lab at school and at makerspaces at MIT, I finally committed to purchasing my own Ender-3 V2 to make things from my imagination into reality.

After learning the basics of slicing softwares and setting up the printbed, I've spent countless hours printing cool knicknacks for friends and family, as well as decorations for my room.

### RGB Lighting

I love RGB animations and whenever I approach a personal project, I always look for ways to incorporate these cool lighting effects. For my desktop setup, all the options I found online priced ridiculously high so I took it into my own hands to make something myself over winter break.
Using my newly acquired 3D printer and some online searching, I found some CAD files online and edited them for my purpose to make a custom RGB wall decoration along with soldered rgb strips.

## My Workstation

### Gaming PC's

I've built a couple of computer rigs over the past couple years, but the one I currently use is a custom Mini-ITX tower that I designed to be able to easily bring back and forth to school in a carryon.

### Keyboards

During my quest to perfect my workstation which emerged from my time studying fro home due to covid, I got into the hobby of custom keyboards. I've modded 3 keyboards so far, and my favorite is my 75% GMMK Pro.

I first started with the barebones aluminum CNC milled casing from Glorious:

I then lubed the individual switches to get a nice smooth feeling with each keystroke before mounting them onto the keyboard PCB:

Here's the final product!
