I recently joined the MIT Motorsports team over IAP this year to further pursue my passion for hands-on mechanical engineering. During my short time on the team so far, I've gained loads of experience and knowledge about Siemens NX, CNC manufacturing, powder coating, and much more.

The leaning curve with a new CAD and CAM software was steep but with the help of very supportive team members and friends I was able to get up and running very quickly during crunch time for powertrain manufacturing.

While I had previous academic experience in CNC CAM with [my 2.008 project](../../projects/2.008), motorsports really taught me the entire process such as prepping stock, setting up the tools in the CNC, ways to locate on a part for multiple operations, and various stock mounting methods.

Looking forward to a great competition season!
